<p>2019 marks the tenth year in which I&#8217;ve reviewed the most important &#8220;trends&#8221; in education technology from the previous twelve months. (You can look at the topics I&#8217;ve covered in previous years here on <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">research.hackeducation.com</a>.)</p>

<p>I barely made it to ten. (Sorry. I am writing a goddamn book.)</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://2019trends.hackeducation.com/2019/12/23/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish2">The Stories That Were Told about Education Technology in 2019</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://2019trends.hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow:>The Decade in Ed-Tech</a></li>
</ul>	

<p>(This project includes <a href="http://2019trends.hackeducation.com/blog">a blog</a> where you can read a handful of supplemental stories about how I work as well as my thoughts throughout the year on these (and other) &#8220;trends.&#8221;</p>
